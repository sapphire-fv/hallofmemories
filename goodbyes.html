I hope the best for everyone of you and I hope you all cherish this family. You will never experience this ever again. Happier and sadder, you can experience. The experience we created can never be recreated and I hope that we all cherished it to the best of our abilities."

				"I'm not very good at words but I just want everyone to know that they are doing great and well, even at this time of the pandemic, that we are trying our best to cope up, working hard so we can achieve our goals, be successful in our paths. Even if we separate and maybe forget me/us, I hope that all the years we have spent together were great, that even if we are close to each other or not, that you were still able to contribute to the fun that whole sapphire has created. I wish you guys good health and to be successful in whatever, wherever you guys will be heading to, I hope that many chances and good opportunities come in your way and all that. Also we already experienced tons of hardships together as a class, so if you encounter any obstacles in your life, your future, always know that things aren't so impossible, and that you can do it! Just believe in yourself and never give up. We still have a long way ahead so we have lots of things to know, to improve on, so don't stress yourself too much, and sometimes just breathe and take a break. I could say I'm happy and proud of each one of u and that you guys made my middle school and high school years memorable and fruitful. I hope we are still able to meet each other perhaps, even at least a few hi's and hello's and support one another. ilysm <33"

				"All I want to say is sobrang saya ng sapphire as in. I remember going to school para lang makausap mga friends ko and di na talaga ko nakikinig ng mga subjects. Sana mag kita kita pa tayo ulit kasi ang panget ng pag end ng school year na iyon dahil sa Covid-19, nag end ng hindi tayo nagkita kita which is sobrang sad talaga. I wish everyone a goodluck sa mga mag iibang school and sana matupad niyo ang mga gusto niyo at wag susuko sa pag-aaral kahit ako mismo hirap sa pag-aaral and yun lang sana mag kita kita pa ulit tayo. <3 I love you all"

				"I'm not sure if you guys will remember me in 10 years, or even 5, but I just hope that the memories that we made along the way will stay with you. Because I'll definitely remember them, because even the bad ones, they will forever help me remember that I'm happy to have met people like you, and I'm happy that each one of you helped made each memory memorable. When I ever get the possibility of having kids, I will definitely tell them the times where we all had laughs, tears, and love from one another. If you're one of the ones who'll transfer, I hope you succeed and go with happiness and pride. Celebrate with your friends and family if you pass. If you plan on going to college, I wish you the strength and luck to achieve your dreams and ambitions. To finish this off, I'm happy to have met friends that I love as a family, and I wish every one of you guys the best in the future, and I hope that you'll remember me as I'll remember you guys till the day I reach the end of the line. If you ever want someone to vibe with, or just to listen to you, I'll gladly be there. Thank you all for the memories along the way, and I hope we make more in the future. Love you all and take care always <3"

				"every time i think i'm happy to go, i remember who i'm leaving. i can't believe i've known most of you for years--and the length varies between ten months to eleven whole years and counting. i can't believe how big of a part the people in this section play in how happy i am with myself. you were one of the first people i was comfortable with telling about these facets of myself--even while i was still figuring it out. thank you so much for every opportunity to know and be known. it's dramatic as hell but i really am thankful for this section. it was fun and completely fascinating to see everyone grow more into themselves and i hate that i'd be missing years of it. we have things to do that are beyond ourselves, though--things we've all been working towards for a long time (even unwittingly) and things we have to do ourselves. i wish you all good luck. i'm here for anything, especially when i'll be missing our routine of helping each other, so don't even worry about messaging me for anything. take care, sapphire."

				"Damn, time is so fast that we are already ending JHS. It was just a while back that we we're Grade 1 and doing random things such as being noisy all the time and not knowing what to do. I mean we are still noisy rn but we matured and it is normal. I had a lot of fun times in my 10 years as part of this section and I think that all of us will be successful one day. Even though we had a lot of irs and pasaway moments, we are still have a very strong bond and happy moments. Sana ay magkita pa tayo and have a good time in the reunion of Sapphire. I hope that everyone will live a long happy and prosperous life to everyone in the future and I hope that we will still be friends. Thank you all for the fun memories that we created and I hope that it will continue in the future. See you all in the next chapter of our lives."

				"Mahal kong Sapphire, <br>
				Nais ko kayong batiin sapagkat napagtagumpayan niyo ang SY na ito kahit na alam kong mahirap ang ating kasalukuyang setup. Kahit hindi niyo na ako kasama, nakikibalita pa rin ako tungkol sa inyo, at marami akong naririnig na magagandang bagay tungkol sa inyo. Sobrang nakaka-proud kayo! <br>
				Miss na miss ko na kayo. Walang araw na hindi kayo sumagi sa isip ko. Isang taon na tayong hindi nagkikita. Pero ganoon talaga, darating ang pagkakataong kailangan na talagang maghiwa-hiwalay upang tahakin ang kani-kaniyang landas at abutin ang kani-kaniyang pangarap. Gayunman, baon-baon natin lagi sa ating mga puso ang mga masasayang alaala noong tayo'y magkakasama saanman tayo makarating. <br>
				Good luck sa inyong senior high school life, and eventually, college life. Alam kong magiging matagumpay kayo sa inyong mga karera at magiging mabubuting mamamayan. Lagi lang akong nandito para sa inyo. Sa bawat tagumpay, ako'y papalakpak para sa inyo. Sa bawat kabiguan, narito lang din ako para damayan kayo. Hindi mapapatid ng distansiya ang ating ugnayan sapagkat binuo iyon ng pagmamahal. <br>
				Lagi kayong mag-iingat! Magkikita pa tayo sa hinaharap. :) <br> <br>
				Lubos na nagmamahal, <br>
				Sir Jay"
