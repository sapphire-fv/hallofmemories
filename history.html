They're probably the memories that you do not remember, but these were the times wherein we had the most fun in our stay in O.B. Fairview. O.B. just progressingly keeps getting worse in their management. It became obvious after Grade 1. We had only one teacher for all major subjects which was our advisor and we only meet new teachers during special subjects such as our OG teacher Sir Cases. Also, this is the lowest number of Gems in Sapphire since we were only 18 in the class. </h5>

Jace and Gaby throwing milo and coins outside of the window trying to hit a car and getting caught by a parent downstairs will always be memorable.

Canteen stonks went up becuase students just want to buy Mogu Mogu to play flip the bottle with their friends. But this seemingly harmless game also caused another near-IR experience. Someone flipped the bottle so high up that it accidentally hit the lights and exposed O.B's cheap taped lights. And to make it worse, Jace tried to fixed it and instead of fixing it, the plastic covering fell to the ground together with O.B's cheap tape.</p>
